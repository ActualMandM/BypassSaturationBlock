# High Refresh Rate

Code for a MM+ mod that allows the game to run at higher framerates, alongside replacing the game's frame limiter with a more precise one.

## Special thanks

 - [KingKrouch](https://github.com/KingKrouch) for the original cheat engine table that this mod was based off of.
 - [Skyth](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds) for the code that prevents the game from passing single-threaded flags to D3D11.
 - [Michael Fadely](https://github.com/michael-fadely) for the frame limiter from [sadx-frame-limit](https://github.com/michael-fadely/sadx-frame-limit).
