# High Refresh Rate

Code for a Mega Mix+ mod that implements the camera component from [PD Loader](https://github.com/PDModdingCommunity/PD-Loader)'s TLAC, allowing you to basically take the camera anywhere you'd want.

## Special thanks

 - [nastys](https://github.com/nastys) for the original code in PD-Loader's TLAC.
 - [Skyth](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds) for the control scheme from GenerationsFreeCamera.
